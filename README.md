## Inspiration
I came up with the idea for this hack because I was fed up of my school's washrooms being unavailable because of people doing illegal activity in the washrooms, such as smoking or vaping. However, simply ignoring the issue wasn't going to solve anything, but at the same time, the process of reporting the issue was too much of a hassle to be feasible. Most of the time when I would discover illegal activity in the washrooms, I would be on my way to class, and reporting the issue would cause me to be late.

## What it does
It allows people to report incidents in the exact location they witness it using our app, which then sends notifications staff that would deal with these problems (e.g. hall monitors).

## How we built it
We decided to build it using Kotlin because it was a powerful language for Android development, and many of our useful features require a close language to the hardware (so frameworks like Flutter couldn't be an option).

## Challenges we ran into
Learning Kotlin was a large difficulty for us, but we managed (through very intense and frustrating hours) to finally get the code running and learned a lot throughout the journey!

## What's next for QuikReport
This app could really be useful in actual schools and their environment.
